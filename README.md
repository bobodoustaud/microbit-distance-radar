microbit distance radar with lcd 16\*2 display

Use the vittasciences website to build the project due to a certain library used : [vittascience.com](https://en.vittascience.com/microbit/?mode=code&console=bottom&toolbox=vittascience)

I made this for a school project, so the code sucks. Feel free to take inspiration from it for your own school project or whatever you are trying to do.

Requires a microbit v2, a grove i/o shield, a basic ultrasonic distance sensor plugged in the third slot and a 16\*2 seeed lcd screen plugged in the first slot.
